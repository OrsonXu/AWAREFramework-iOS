//  This is a sample application (DynamicESM) using ESM with sensor data.
//  In this example, this application sends a notification based on device usage.
//  If a user uses the phone more than 10 min in a session, this application sends
//  a push notification and survey on the phone. The survey is valid only 30 minutes.
